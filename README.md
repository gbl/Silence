Mod description
===============

You might need to silence Minecraft quickly without wanting to turn you PC speakers off,
for example, when you're getting a zoom call. This mod adds a keybind to do that:
pressing the key (by default F12, can be configured in Options/Controls) will set
the Master Volume (from Options/Music and Sounds) to 0, pressing the key again restores
the original value.

Optionally, you can auto-silence Minecraft when it loses focus, and restore the sound
when Minecraft regains focus.
